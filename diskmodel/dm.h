// What is the angle relative to?

// There are three reasonable "zeroes" to speak of.  The first which
// we'll call "literal" or "absolute" zero or just 0 is a fixed point
// that is the same on every track on the disk.  The second is the
// offset of the leading edge of the first sector lying entirely past
// 0 on the track.  This will typically be the same for all of the
// tracks on a given surface within a zone.  We refer to this as 0t
// for "track."  (in the current implementation, 0t is probably the
// same as 0).  The third zero is the offset of the leading edge of
// the block whose lbn is numerically lowest of all of the blocks on
// the track.  This will also probably be the same for all tracks per
// surface,zone.  We refer to this as 0l for lbn or logical.

// 0t is not affected by skews but is affected by 
// slipping in some defect-management schemes.

// 0l is affected by: track and cylinder switch skew as well as
// slipping in some defect-management schemes.

// We try to be precise about which 0 we mean in describing the
// interface below.

// Further complicating this is how to number the sectors on a given
// track in pbns.  It would be reasonable to call either the one at 0t
// sector zero or the one at 0l sector zero.
