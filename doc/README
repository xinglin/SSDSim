This directory contains a copy of the user's manual for Disksim 2.0,
released in 1999 (disksim-doc.ps).  While it is out of date, it could
provide some useful background.  

Outline.txt describes the innards of Disksim 2.0 in some detail, with
information on the flow of events, memory management, and some changes
that were made before the release of 2.0.  It is also out of date, but
could provide some insight to future developers.

The disksim4-manual.pdf is a copy of the  user's manual for Disksim 4.0.
