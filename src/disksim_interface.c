/*
 *
 * This file offers a suggested interface between disksim and a full
 * system simulator.  Using this interface (which assumes only a few
 * characteristics of the system simulator), disksim will act as a
 * slave of the system simulator, providing disk request completion
 * indications in time for an interrupt to be generated in the system
 * simulation.  Specifically, disksim code will only be executed when
 * invoked by one of the procedures in this file.
 *
 * Using ths interface requires only two significant functionalities
 * of the system simulation environment:
 *
 * 1. the ability to function correctly without knowing when a disk
 * request will complete at the time that it is initiated.  Via the
 * code in this file, the system simulation will be informed at some
 * later point in its view of time that the request is completed.  (At
 * this time, the appropriate "disk request completion" interrupt
 * could be inserted into the system simulation.)
 *
 * 2. the ability for disksim to register a callback with the system
 * simulation environment.  That is, this client code must be able to
 * say, "please invoke this function when the simulated time reaches
 * X".  It is also helpful to be able to "deschedule" a callback at a
 * later time -- but lack of this support can certainly be worked
 * around.
 *
 * To use the external interface, your program should link with
 * libdisksim.a and disksim_interface.o.  See syssim.* for a good
 * example.
