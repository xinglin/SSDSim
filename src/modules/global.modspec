PROTO int disksim_global_loadparams(struct lp_block *b);

PARAM Init Seed				I	0 
INIT disksim->seedval = i;
INIT DISKSIM_srand48(disksim->seedval);
# INIT fprintf (outputfile, "Init Seed: PID (%d)\n", disksim->seedval);

This specifies the initial seed for the random number generator.
The initial seed value is applied at the very beginning of the 
simulation and is used during the initialization phase (e.g.,~for 
determining initial rotational positions).  Explicitly specifying the 
random generator seed enables experiment repeatability.

PARAM Init Seed with time		I	0 
TEST RANGE(i,0,1)
INIT if(i) { disksim->seedval = DISKSIM_time(); }
If a nonzero value is provided, DiskSim will use the current system 
time to initialize the ``Init Seed'' parameter.

PARAM Real Seed				I	0 
INIT disksim->seedval = i;

The `real' seed value is applied after the initialization phase
and is used during the simulation phase (e.g.,~for synthetic 
workload generation).  This allows multiple synthetic workloads 
(with different simulation seeds) to be run on equivalent 
configurations (i.e.,~with identical initial seeds, 
as specified above).


PARAM Real Seed with time		I	0 
TEST RANGE(i,0,1)
INIT disksim->seedval = DISKSIM_time();
If a nonzero value is provided, DiskSim will use the current system 
time to initialize the ``Real Seed'' parameter.


# in milliseconds
PARAM Statistic warm-up time		D	0 
TEST (d >= 0)
INIT disksim->warmup_event = (timer_event *) getfromextraq(); 
INIT disksim->warmup_event->type = TIMER_EXPIRED; 
INIT disksim->warmup_event->time = d * (double) 1000.0; 
INIT disksim->warmup_event->func = &disksim->timerfunc_disksim;
This specifies the amount of simulated time after which the statistics
will be reset.

PARAM Statistic warm-up IOs		I	0
TEST (i >= 0)
INIT disksim->warmup_iocnt = i;
This specifies the number of I/Os after which the statistics will be reset.

PARAM Stat definition file		S	1 
INIT char *path = lp_search_path(lp_cwd, s);
INIT if(!path) {
INIT   ddbg_assert2(0, "Couldn't find statdefs file in path");
INIT }
INIT else {
INIT   statdeffile = fopen(path, "r");
INIT   ddbg_assert2(statdeffile != 0, "failed to open statdefs file!");
INIT }

This specifies the name of the input file containing the
specifications for the statistical distributions to collect.  This
file allows the user to control the number and sizes of histogram bins
into which data are collected.  This file is mandatory.
Section~\ref{output.statdefs} describes its use.

PARAM Output file for trace of I/O requests simulated		S	0
TEST (outios = fopen(s, "w")) != NULL
INIT strcpy(disksim->outiosfilename, s);

This specifies the name of the output file to contain a trace of disk
request arrivals (in the default ASCII trace format described in
Section~\ref{input.traces}).  This allows instances of synthetically
generated workloads to be saved and analyzed after the simulation
completes.  This is particularly useful for analyzing (potentially
pathological) workloads produced by a system-level model.


PARAM Detailed execution trace		S	0
TEST (disksim->exectrace = fopen(s, "w")) != NULL
INIT disksim->exectrace_fn = strdup(s);

This specifies the name of the output file to contain a detailed trace
of system execution -- req issue/completion, etc.
