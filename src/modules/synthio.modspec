MODULE synthio
HEADER \#include "../disksim_synthio.h"
RESTYPE int
PROTO int disksim_synthio_loadparams(struct lp_block *b);

PARAM Number of I/O requests to generate	I	1 
TEST i > 0
INIT synthio_endiocnt = i;

This specifies the number of independent, concurrent, request-generating
processes.

PARAM Maximum time of trace generated		D	1 
TEST d > 0.0
INIT synthio_endtime = d; synthio_endtime *= 1000.0;

This specifies the maximum number of I/O requests to generate before
ending the simulation run.  A simulation run continues until either
the specified number of requests is generated or the maximum
simulation time (see below) is reached.

PARAM System call/return with each request	I	1 
TEST RANGE(i,0,1)
INIT synthio_syscalls = i;

This specifies whether or not each request occurs within the context of a
system call (which may affect the behavior of the associated process
in the system-level model).  If true~(1), each request will be
preceded by a system call event and followed by a system call return
event.

PARAM Think time from call to request		D	1 
TEST d >= 0.0
INIT synthio_syscall_time = d;

This specifies the think time (i.e., computation time) between the system
call event and the disk request event.  This parameter is only
relevant if the above Boolean parameter is set to true~(1).

PARAM Think time from request to return		D	1 
TEST d >= 0.0
INIT synthio_sysret_time = d;

This specifies the think time (i.e., computation time) between the disk
request event and the system call return event.  This parameter is
only relevant if the above Boolean parameter is set to true~(1).

PARAM Generators				LIST	1 
TEST !loadsynthgenerators(0,l)

A list of synthgen block values describing the generators.
